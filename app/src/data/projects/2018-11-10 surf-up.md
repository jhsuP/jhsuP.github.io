Surf's Up: Dog Edition is a project I worked on in ICS111. This is a one player game and controlled with WASD keys to control the dog. It is written using Java along with [EZ Library](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dylank/ics111/). The objective of the game was to survive as long as possible. 3 Sharks appear randomly from the left side of the screen at random speeds. To increase food and water supply, you must collect bottled cans and bones. Once collected, they disappear and re-appears in some random location. If you get hit by the shark, you lose a % of food and water. As the dog moves, they expend food and water. If either reach 0%, you lose.

In this project, we were required to have 5 different classes for:
- Water Bottles
- Food Items
- Player
- Shark
- Game

Throughout the process of creating the game, I learned how to instantiate Objects and the
 importance of having clear variables. When I first began, I gave names such as ``DogStart`` and ``DogStarting``. The first was the player object, and the second was to control the introduction screen. The naming convention confused me greatly later on as the code grew longer so I eventually had to change the variables into ones that made more sense such as ``player`` and ``Game_Start``.

In my free time I like to fiddle around with Graphics so for this project, I spent a lot of time editing images to make the game look pleasing to the eyes. Assets and sprites were taken online from MapleStory.
