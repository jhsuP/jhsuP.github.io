summary: The "career goal" section helped me find a sense of direction when I didn't even know I needed it. I like the way it is organized, whereupon clicking on said career, it provides more information on what the job might be like and what potential courses to take. When I first began ICS, the only jobs I knew were “Programmers” and “Game Developers”. That was it. I didn’t realize there was such a diverse field that branched out to DevOps Engineer or even UX Developer. When navigating interests, I didn’t realize that it also showed “related courses” and “related opportunities”. This helped me plan out what extra-curricular I wanted to do next year and made me have a sense of direction as I can <i>physically</i> see how the year will look like. I also absolutely love stickers, and the cover of my laptop can attest to that. So when I found out we were able to get stickers for leveling it, I was elated. It became one of my main motivation and incentive to look for more opportunities. While gaining knowledge and experience is important, having something that’s small and fun makes the experience a lot more enjoyable for me.

## A Sense of Direction

The "career goal" section helped me find a sense of direction when I didn't even know I needed it.

## Wishlist

**Projects**

I think it would be useful to have a tab or section on RadGrad for group projects. For example, in the Engineering Department, the students get assigned a group project in their Sophomore, Junior, and senior year. It would be interesting to start up something like that in our major and have RadGrad be a centralized place for people to find more information about said project, look for groups, etc. We could also open it up to personal projects. Students can pitch their idea, advertise their group, and their contact information. I know some personal group projects are formed in ICSpace or even on ACM’s Discord, but not everyone goes to ICSpace or has a Discord. However, everyone can access RadGrad. I believe this would incentivize and increase the usage of RadGrad by having everything in a centralized location. 

Group projects are something that can be shown to future employers as it not only shows them that you understand the concept well enough to make something, but that you can also function well in a team. There are some things that can only be taught in group projects. ICS 314 for example taught me a lot about version control, how to communicate, and how to handle merge errors. All those skills are something I would not have learned if I were to code by myself.

## A Rad Change
**Verification**

One of the changes I would make would be with the verification process. At the moment, I feel the text box for documentation is too tiny. Making it larger makes it more visually appealing and easier for a student to edit.

Additionally, some of the opportunities listed ask for photo verification. However, there are no places for a student to upload their images, meaning they have to upload it somewhere else then link it in the documentation. This makes the process tedious and could deter some students from even trying. We can streamline it by either adding an “Upload image” button or removing the photo verification altogether. 


**Degree Plan**

I would add some form of instructions on how to use the “PLAN” tab. For example having some text saying “Add to your degree plan by clicking and dragging the courses below” as when I first started, I was unaware you <i>could</i> actually move it.

Having some way to read from STAR the courses we have registered for / have taken would also make things easier. 

**Explorer**

I would also add the ability for a student to favorite a course on the explore page, instead of having to click ``“View More > Add to Favorites”.`` Because in our “PLAN”, it only lists courses required for our selected major and other electives as “ICS 400+”, it makes it tedious. For example, if I wanted to add ICS 466 to my degree plan, I would have to go  ``Explorer > Courses > Find ICS 466 > Add to Favorites`` whereas having a button to add it would reduce the process to ``Explorer > courses > ICS 466``. It makes it easier for students to add to their degree planners if they already know what courses they want to take as all they have to do is click the buttons. The same logic would apply for opportunities. 

**Bugs(?)**

While I was updating my degree plan, I ran into some minor bugs. Or rather, the course listings have not been updated. For example, I was trying to put “ICS 321” onto my plan when I realized on RadGrad, it was titled “Data Storage and Retrieval” but on STAR & Class Availability, it was named “Database Systems I”. The same issue arose with ICS 421 which was titled “Database Base Systems” but on STAR it was called “Database Systems II”. It’s not too big of an issue, but it did confuse me a little. 

## RadGrad sure is Rad
As I am approaching my last year of being an ICS student, I have to admit that RadGrad definitely contributed to my growth. Declaring ICS as my second major in my Junior year was definitely scary and at times I was confused and thought it was a mistake. However, RadGrad, along with my professors, classmates, advisors, and friends really helped me realize how much I love computer science. RadGrad allowed me to explore opportunities that I didn’t even know existed and without it, I probably would not have done ICPC in Fall 2019 or joined ICSpark, and I definitely would not have the opportunity to combine my two majors together -- helping others (Social Work) and coding (Computer Science)!
