summary: “You can major in anything you want, just don’t choose the same major I did.” — My dad . And guess what? Ironically enough, I chose the exact. Same. Major. My dad graduated from the University of Hawai’i with a B.A in Information & Computer Science. Some of my earliest memories would include him sitting on his computer, speaking with words that I did not understand. It was not only until I decided to major in ICS did my dad tell me what those words were -- Java.

And guess what? Ironically enough, I chose the exact. Same. Major.

My dad graduated from the University of Hawai’i with a B.A in Information & Computer Science. Some of my earliest memories would include him sitting on his computer, speaking with words that I did not understand. It was not only until I decided to major in ICS did my dad tell me what those words were -- Java. 

As a child, I was fascinated with the idea that my dad could create something out of nothing. That sparked my interest in computers, where I spent most of my time online, playing games such as Maplestory or World of Warcraft. My first actual programming "experience" was through customizing my DeviantArt profile to look pretty. At the time, my knowledge was limited to using HTML to insert images, add hyperlinks, and align text. That started my interest in Web Development.

When I first began university, I decided to major in Social Work because I love helping individuals, but Computer Science was always something at the back of my mind. It was not until the end of my sophomore year did I realize it was possible to integrate my two passions together. Through my social work courses, I learned that Social Workers need help. I was able to witness the many struggles that they faced. Many are overwhelmed with the amount of work they have -- I have friends who are case managers to over 30+ individuals. I wanted to help them.

That is where Computer Science, specifically Software Engineering, comes in. I want to use the knowledge I've gained from Social Work and transfer it into programs, websites, and/or applications that can help relieve some of their burden. For some non-profits, it may be a better data management system to help keep track of personal files for their clients. For others, it may be to create a website that centralizes resources and referrals commonly used by Social Workers. All I know is that I want to integrate my two passions together. I hope through this class I will be able to learn more about project management and the details behind quality assurance, development environments, testing, and other software engineering concepts.
