I thought I knew everything about how to ask a question -- Mock Trial & Speech and Debate in high school taught me how to frame questions to obtain specific answers, conducting a survey based research project in Psychology taught me how certain words can affect the reliability of our results, and Social Work taught me how reframing a question to focus more on the person than the situation can allow a client to be more open.

It turns out I have so much more to learn. There is no doubt that whenever we hit an error such as ``segmentation fault (core dumped)``, one of the first places we turn to is Google -- namely StackOverflow. Ever find a question that has your exact same problem but when you click on it, the author responds with “thanks, I fixed it,'' _without_ offering the solution? We have all been there and we know how incredibly frustrating it can be. Well, it turns out Eric Raymond’s “[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)” not only deconstructs the way we ask our question to help us receive a response in a timely manner, but also explains the proper etiquette on forums so that in the future, we can avoid situations like this.

What makes a “smart” question? It boils down to these key points:
- Be informative but precise -- if you can ask the same question in less words, do it.
- Give examples that allow others to replicate your error
- Make sure your question is formatted properly and grammatically correct
- Make it easy to reply to
- Do your research, explain what you have already tried
- Use short, but meaningful subject headers that layout your problem

Of course, it is easier said than done. Examples are one of the best ways to highlight the difference between a “smart” and a “not so smart” question.

### A "Not So Smart" Question

As seen above, the question was marked as **[closed]** in less than an hour. Why was this a bad question? For starters, it is easy to tell that this is a homework question. Asking for hints on homework is perfectly okay, but one should at least make an attempt at doing it before asking. It is easy to tell that the poster is more invested in finding the solution than learning. A much better question would be to post their attempt and ask for clarification. Someone even replied with “Please provide the code to your best attempt.” within the same hour the question was posted. This goes to show that people are willing to help, it’s just that they are much more likely to help if you show that you did your research first.

### A "Smart" Question

How is this different from a “not so smart” question? At first glance, you can tell the difference. For one, this developer has a meaningful header - even without clicking the link, one can tell what environment they are using. It makes it stand out easier -- those who are familiar with Android development are more likely to click this than a generic “SQLite Error: 3850 on phone”. Secondly, the developer gives a brief history on what happened before they encountered the error, the error itself, and show that they have done their research by linking the error documentation from SQLite. This makes the question easier to reply to by narrowing down the problem.

### Takeaways
Through these examples, it shows that the more thought you put into ensuring that it is a “smart” question, the more likely you’ll receive an answer. People answer questions in their free time out of their own goodwill. Do your share of the work, be respectful to the online community, and you receive the same generosity back.
