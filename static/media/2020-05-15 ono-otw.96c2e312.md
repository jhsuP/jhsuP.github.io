Ono OTW was a website application my team and I develop as our final project for ICS 314. This application is tailored to UH Manoa students. For students who do not want to interrupt their work to go out to buy for food, they are able to order from a range of food on campus and near campus. This site provides the ability to be both a deliverer and a customer in a single account that can be switched by using the toggle bar provided in the navigation bar. For students who want to make some cash during their 7-hour gap between classes, they can deliver food. After delivery, students are able to rate their service. Their profile shows their recent delivery and/or order, as well as any restaurants they have favorited. Administrators on the site are able to add, delete, and edit restaurants.

For this project, I contributed to both the front-end and back-end implementation. Additionally, I helped design the user interface, mock-ups, website logo, and managed the GitHub documentation page.

Some of the pages I was in charge of include:
- Sign in
- Restaurant (Back-end & Front end)
  - Ability to favorite 
- Search by restaurant’s name 
- Profile (Back-end & Front-end)
  - Ability to Edit
- Feature of recent orders & deliveries
- Rating (Back-end & Front-end)
  - Ability to rate deliverers
- Accept Order (Back-end & Front end)
- Add Restaurant (Front-end)

Some of the pages I helped with were:
- Cart (back-end)
  - Consolidate multiple food orders into 1 card
- Deliver Order (Back-end)
- Navigation bar
- Menu (back-end)

My main contributions would be basic functionality and helping link the different data collections together (eg. Accept Order → Deliver Order). Working with a team was fun, but it also presented a fair share of challenges. As our semester was disrupted halfway by COVID-19, we were not able to meet up as frequently as I would have liked. Additionally, some had other responsibilities and could not dedicate as much time to the project. Despite these challenges, we were able to finish the project by communicating often on Discord, joining voice calls, and having the GitHub webhook update us on any changes made. I gained a lot from this project, from understanding how to work together on a group coding project (my first one!) to integrating everything I’ve learned this semester. It simulated a real-life work environment that I found incredibly beneficial as it allowed me to work on my communication skills and deepen my understanding on proper project management, GitHub, and web design.
