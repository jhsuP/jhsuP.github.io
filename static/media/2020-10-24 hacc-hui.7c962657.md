summary: The goal of the HACC Hui system is to provide an easy-to-use system that simplifies and improves the team formation process for the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge.

In a typical year, over 200 developers
  attend the [HACC](https://hacc.hawaii.gov/)  kick-off meeting. This size makes it difficult for
   developers to know each
   other and form teams through informal mechanisms. In light of the pandemic, there will be no
    in-person kick-off meeting this year. This application was built for address this issue. It is built using React, MongoDB, Meteor, and [Semantic-UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

Initially, we were split up into teams of 4-5 and at the start of each new milestone, we forked
 the "master" HACC-Hui repo into our team's organization. Each [milestone](http://hacc-hui.github.io/docs/requirements/milestone1) contained [different
  user
  stories](https://hacc-hui.github.io/docs/requirements/installers) that had to be implemented and at the end of the deadline, our professor picked the
   first implementation that would be added to the master repository. Then the process restarted
    for each milestone. However after the 3rd milestone, it was changed so everyone worked on the
     master repository. Thus, below I will break down the issues I worked on for the first 3
      milestones then the ones I worked on in the master repo.

## [Milestone 1](https://github.com/400-iq/HACC-Hui/projects/1)
- Helped design mock-ups
- Implement Landing Page
- Implement Team Creation (both backend & front-end)
- Design profile UI (front-end)

## [Milestone 2](https://github.com/400-iq/HACC-Hui/projects/2)
- Team Finder (both backend & front-end)
   - The filters query base on AND logic

## [Milestone 3](https://github.com/400-iq/HACC-Hui/projects/3)
- Allow team owners to send "direct invite" to participants (both backend & front-end)
    - It throws an error when:
        - User tries to invite self
        - User tries to invite someone who was already invited
        - User tries to invite a user that doesn't have an account
        - User can only successfully send invitations when there are no errors.

## [Master Repo](https://github.com/HACC-Hui/HACC-Hui/projects/1)
- Update navigation bar to be mobile friendly
- Fixed Team Creation to allow users to create a team without listing participants 
- Implemented a page where team leaders can see who is interested in their team

## Takeaways

My main contributions would be basic functionality and helping link the different data
 collections together (eg. Team Creation + Team Invitations). My team, 400-IQ, consisted of James
  Bennett
 , Kelli Tamashiro, and Lucy Rock. Before each milestone, we would discuss what issues we want to
  work on. Some issues were closely linked or dependent on each other, such as Team Invitations
   depended on the Participant Finder to work so for issues like that, we would coordinate on
    Discord. We decided to meet outside of class time every Monday & Wednesday at 6pm to discuss
     our updates and troubleshoot if needed.
  Working with a
  team
  was fun, but it also presented a fair share of challenges. This was the first project I worked
   on that had a live client so it was amazing to experience the workflow -- even when it was all
    done remotely. Utilizing Discord as a platform for class and having clients and our
     classmates review our milestones to give feedback offered an experience I have never had
      before. It made me realize how many different ways there were to implement something as
       trivial as Team Finder. One could simply use a search bar, or use a series of filters to
        give targeted results. Working with such a large team towards the end (~20 students) in the
         master repo also presented unique challenges such as merge errors, which was something I rarely experienced in a smaller team.

In all, it was extremely rewarding and I would like to thank my teammates as well as Professor
 Moore for providing me with this amazing opportunity. Now that the actual application is up and
  running, it is time for me to actually use the application as a _participant_ for HACC 2020!
