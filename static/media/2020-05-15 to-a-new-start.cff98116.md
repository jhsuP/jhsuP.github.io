summary: Of all the courses I have taken so far, ICS 314 was probably one of my favorites. While other ICS courses gave me the coding foundations, 314 allowed me to take those concepts and create something in a format that stimulated how it would be like to code in the real world. It broke out of the classroom environment and gave practicality. One of the most important concepts I learned from this class was Project management.

Of all the courses I have taken so far, ICS 314 was probably one of my favorites. While other ICS courses gave me the coding foundations, 314 allowed me to take those concepts and create something in a format that stimulated how it would be like to code in the real world. It broke out of the classroom environment and gave practicality. One of the most important concepts I learned from this class was Project management.  

Project management is not just about coding or even software engineering, it’s about how to work in a cohesive unit and how to be flexible in light of recent changes in our lives. We have all done group work before and are all too familiar with its pros and cons. However aside from the basic idea as planning and the working on parts, I learned that the actual implementation of it in Software Engineering can be quite different. 

## Bottom-Up
Agile project management is one method used to facilitate group work. Utilizing GitHub, tasks are organized with a format called “issue-driven project management”. Instead of having one central idea to work towards, this method breaks the project into sections called “milestones” where each milestone covered a crucial part, building from bottom up. For example, our project was broken up into three milestones, each lasting a week or so in duration. The first milestone consisted of having an overarching idea of what we want to build, and several mockups. The second milestone covered the implementation of the pages along with data models. This is where the bulk of the work was done. The third milestone sought to significantly improve the functionality of the system and test for bugs.

Each milestone had tasks broken up into an issue, which was defined as a branch on GitHub. This allowed us to keep each task organized and hold members accountable. We were able to keep track of each other’s progress and if some issues arose, we were able to switch to their branch to run it locally and attempt to resolve it. As each issue addressed a certain task, merge conflicts did not appear often and were easy to solve.

## Resetting
Using Github also allowed us to use a concept called “configuration management”. Configuration management is a way to manage, organize, and control the changes in documents, codes, and databases. In conjunction with agile project management, each issue has its own defined task that is independent, if not, mostly independent from other issues. This organization gave way to a form of version control -- if something were to break on the master branch we are able to see which issue broke it and restore it to the previous version. Combined with agile project management, this made the development process more smooth and clearer. This method of organization is crucial as any future programmer will rely on group work at some point to complete a project.
